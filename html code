            <img src="images/catphoto2.png" alt="An orange cat next to a strawberry"/>
            <p>I am Pluto, the cat with a blog. I was born in a dark, crummy alley located in New York City. I was one of a set of six kittens. My mother disappeared a few years into my life and 
                my sibling were lucky enough to get picked up off the street shortly after. I would spend days aimlessly wandering the streets of the city, but by doinbg so
                I know my way around it and the best spots to be. Eventually I did get rescued by a nice girl, Venus, she owns an internet cafe in the city and
                that is how I started up this blog, I am beyond thankful. I was alone for a while but ever since I started this blog I have felt even less so. 
                I have recently picked up hobbies like chasing birds and scouting out the best nap spots in NYC, so stay tuned! Meow!

                It's still rainy and cold outside, yuck, not ideal kitty weather. 
                Guess I will just nap all day, oh well.

                Woke up to some parade outside, lots of green humans. Is there such a thing
                as a green cat, and if so contact me asap I must see. Seems like a special day 
                hope I get a treat out of it.

                Venus bought new cat food, don't trust the Meow Mix commercials those
                cats are paid actors. Not cat blog approved.
